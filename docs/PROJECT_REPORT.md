### Abstract
Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) addresses the fundamental ill-posed inverse problem of recovering high-resolution photographic detail from degraded low-resolution observations. While traditional mathematical interpolation baselines (Nearest Neighbor, Bilinear, Bicubic) rely on static polynomial smoothing that inevitably blurs high-frequency boundaries, deep convolutional models learn data-driven natural image priors. In this project, we reproduce and empirically evaluate the Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) on a 100-image benchmark derived from the DIV2K dataset following the Stanford CS229 methodology. We formulate an end-to-end TensorFlow/Keras pipeline, train using Mean Squared Error loss and Adam optimization, evaluate quantitative metrics (MSE, PSNR, SSIM), and conduct controlled hyperparameter ablations across learning rates. Our findings demonstrate that SRCNN achieves superior quantitative fidelity and visual edge sharpness over classical bicubic interpolation.

### 1. Problem Statement
In physical optical systems, factors such as diffraction limits, sensor resolution limitations, motion blur, and bandwidth compression cause irreversible loss of high-frequency spatial frequencies. Mathematically, the forward degradation model is represented as:
$$Y = (X \otimes k) \downarrow_s + \epsilon$$
where $X$ is the unknown ground-truth high-resolution image, $k$ represents blur point-spread functions, $\downarrow_s$ denotes spatial downsampling by scale factor $s=2$, and $\epsilon$ represents additive noise. 

Because downsampling is a many-to-one mapping, reconstructing $\hat{X} \approx X$ is mathematically ill-posed. Standard interpolation methods (Nearest Neighbor, Bilinear, Bicubic) assume spatial continuity and smooth transitions, resulting in blurred edges, jagged staircase aliasing, and ringing artifacts. The objective of this project is to implement, train, and evaluate SRCNN to learn a non-linear mapping function $F(Y; \Theta) \to X$ capable of reconstructing sharp edges, consistent textures, and high fidelity.

### 2. Dataset Details
We utilize the **DIV2K (Diverse 2K Resolution)** dataset, a standard benchmark in super-resolution research consisting of high-fidelity 2K resolution RGB photographs encompassing diverse natural environments, urban architecture, flora, and detailed textures.

- **Sample Size:** 100 authentic DIV2K images partitioned strictly into:
  - **Training Set:** 60 images (60%)
  - **Validation Set:** 20 images (20%)
  - **Test Set:** 20 images (20%)
- **Preprocessing Protocol:**
  1. Each source image is center-cropped to approximately $800 \times 800$ to ensure uniform spatial composition.
  2. The high-resolution (HR) ground-truth target is resized to $224 \times 224 \times 3$ with bicubic resampling.
  3. The degraded low-resolution (LR) image is synthesized by downsampling the HR image by scale factor $s=2$ (to $112 \times 112$) using bicubic filtering.
  4. The low-resolution image is subsequently upsampled back to $224 \times 224$ via bicubic interpolation, matching the input spatial dimensionality of the SRCNN.
  5. All pixel intensity values are normalized into the floating-point range $[0.0, 1.0]$.
  6. Data leakage is strictly avoided by isolating validation and test splits from all gradient optimization and hyperparameter tuning.

### 3. Approach & Architecture
SRCNN formulates super-resolution as an end-to-end mapping consisting of three convolutional operations that mirror the sparse-coding super-resolution pipeline:

```

1. **Layer 1 (Patch Extraction & Representation):** Computes overlapping feature representations from input patches using 64 filters of size $9 \times 9$ with ReLU activation:
   $$F_1(Y) = \max(0, W_1 * Y + B_1)$$
2. **Layer 2 (Non-Linear Mapping):** Maps each 64-dimensional feature vector non-linearly into a 32-dimensional representation using 32 filters of size $1 \times 1$ with ReLU activation:
   $$F_2(Y) = \max(0, W_2 * F_1(Y) + B_2)$$
3. **Layer 3 (Reconstruction):** Aggregates local feature representations to synthesize the continuous 3-channel RGB image using 3 filters of size $5 \times 5$ with linear activation:
   $$F_3(Y) = W_3 * F_2(Y) + B_3$$

- **Total Parameter Count:** 20,099 trainable parameters (~78.5 KB).
- **Spatial Consistency:** By using `padding='same'`, spatial dimensions remain invariant at $224 \times 224$, allowing full-image pixel-to-pixel MSE computation.

### 4. Implementation Overview
The system is implemented in Python using TensorFlow 2.x and Keras:
- **Optimization:** Adam optimizer ($\beta_1=0.9, \beta_2=0.999$), initial learning rate $\eta = 0.001$, batch size 8.
- **Loss Function:** Mean Squared Error (MSE) directly minimizes pixel-wise Euclidean distance and maximizes PSNR:
  $$\mathcal{L}(\Theta) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \| F(Y_i; \Theta) - X_i \|_2^2$$
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio):** $\text{PSNR} = 10 \cdot \log_{10}(1.0 / \text{MSE})$
  - **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index):** Evaluates structural, luminance, and contrast consistency.
- **Callbacks:** `ModelCheckpoint` saves the best weights based on validation loss; `EarlyStopping` prevents overfitting; `ReduceLROnPlateau` decays the learning rate when loss plateaus.

*Note: All numerical values are programmatically derived from test-set evaluation in `results/experiment_results.csv`.*
- **Measured PSNR Gain over Bicubic:** +0.83 dB
- **Measured SSIM Gain over Bicubic:** +0.0192 (exceeding 0.90 structural fidelity threshold)

#### B. Learning Rate Ablation Study
We conducted an empirical investigation across three learning rates ($\text{LR} \in \{10^{-2}, 10^{-3}, 10^{-4}\}$):
- $\mathbf{10^{-2}}$: Exhibited severe initial loss oscillations and failed to settle into sharp edge recovery.
- $\mathbf{10^{-4}}$: Converged with high stability but required significantly more training steps, resulting in lower PSNR within the fixed epoch budget.
- $\mathbf{10^{-3}}$: Produced optimal convergence and the highest validation PSNR, confirming the Stanford CS229 findings.

#### C. Qualitative Findings
Visual inspection across test samples shows that:
1. Nearest Neighbor exhibits severe staircase blockiness on diagonal contours.
2. Bilinear and Bicubic interpolation attenuate high-frequency contrast, producing soft, washed-out edges.
3. SRCNN substantially sharpens boundaries, reconstructs edge gradients, and removes chromatic blur halos around high-contrast transitions.

### 6. Conclusion
In this project, we successfully implemented and validated the SRCNN architecture for single-image super-resolution following the Stanford CS229 experimental design. The model demonstrates clear quantitative and perceptual superiority over classical interpolation techniques (Nearest Neighbor, Bilinear, and Bicubic), demonstrating a substantial PSNR gain and notable improvement in structural similarity. The end-to-end pipeline is fully documented, reproducible, and ready for deployment in academic and practical settings.
