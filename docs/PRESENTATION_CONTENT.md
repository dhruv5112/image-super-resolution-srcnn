### Slide 2: Problem Statement & Motivation
- **The Core Problem:**
  - Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is an ill-posed inverse problem.
  - Optical sensor limits, data compression, and physical transmission constraints irreversibly discard high-frequency spatial information.
- **Why Classical Interpolation Fails:**
  - Nearest Neighbor, Bilinear, and Bicubic interpolation rely strictly on local polynomial smoothing.
  - They produce severe blur, jagged edges (aliasing), and halo ringing artifacts without recovering true high-frequency edge priors.
- **Real-World Impact:**
  - Medical diagnostics (improving MRI/CT scan clarity without increased radiation dosage).
  - Satellite remote sensing & aerial reconnaissance.
  - Forensic surveillance & license plate identification.
  - Multimedia upscaling for ultra-high-definition displays.

### Slide 3: Dataset & Preprocessing Pipeline
- **Dataset:** DIV2K (Diverse 2K Resolution High-Quality Dataset).
- **Subset Protocol:** 100 authentic high-resolution images matching Stanford CS229 reference standard:
  - **Train:** 60 images (60%)
  - **Validation:** 20 images (20%)
  - **Test:** 20 images (20%)
- **Systematic Preprocessing Pipeline:**
  1. Center crop to $800 \times 800$ to maintain uniform aspect ratios and eliminate non-informative borders.
  2. Resize target ground truth high-resolution (HR) image to $224 \times 224 \times 3$.
  3. Synthesize low-resolution (LR) image by bicubic downsampling by scale factor $s=2$ (to $112 \times 112$).
  4. Upsample LR back to $224 \times 224$ using bicubic interpolation to create paired network input tensors.
  5. Normalize all pixel intensities to $[0.0, 1.0]$ float32.

### Slide 4: SRCNN Architecture & Layer Mechanics
- **End-to-End Deep Learning Architecture:**
  - Formulated as a 3-layer fully convolutional network (Dong et al., TPAMI 2016).
  - Maintains spatial resolution across all layers using `padding='same'`.
- **Three Functional Layers:**
  1. **Patch Extraction & Representation:**
     - Conv2D: 64 filters, $9 \times 9$ kernel, ReLU activation.
     - Extracted feature maps: $224 \times 224 \times 64$ (15,616 parameters).
  2. **Non-Linear Mapping:**
     - Conv2D: 32 filters, $1 \times 1$ kernel, ReLU activation.
     - Non-linear cross-channel compression: $224 \times 224 \times 32$ (2,080 parameters).
  3. **High-Resolution Reconstruction:**
     - Conv2D: 3 filters, $5 \times 5$ kernel, Linear activation.
     - Reconstructed RGB output: $224 \times 224 \times 3$ (2,403 parameters).
- **Total Model Parameters:** 20,099 parameters (~78.5 KB) — extremely fast inference and low memory footprint.

### Slide 5: Methodology & Experimental Design
- **Loss Function:** Mean Squared Error (MSE), directly minimizing pixel-wise squared error and maximizing PSNR.
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio):** Logarithmic metric measuring reconstruction fidelity in decibels (dB).
  - **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure):** Evaluates structural, luminance, and contrast consistency perceived by the Human Visual System.
- **Optimization:** Adam optimizer, initial $\text{LR} = 0.001$, batch size 8, ReduceLROnPlateau and EarlyStopping callbacks.
- **Three Controlled Experiments:**
  - **Experiment A:** Classical interpolation baselines (Nearest, Bilinear, Bicubic).
  - **Experiment B:** Primary SRCNN training with validation monitoring.
  - **Experiment C:** Hyperparameter learning rate ablation ($\text{LR} \in \{10^{-2}, 10^{-3}, 10^{-4}\}$).

---

### Slide 6: Experiments & Training Dynamics
- **Training Convergence:**
  - Rapid MSE reduction in initial epochs, smoothly plateauing near optimal weights.
  - Validation PSNR steadily improves from 14 dB up towards ~25+ dB.
- **Learning Rate Sensitivity:**
  - $\text{LR} = 10^{-2}$: High initial instability, suboptimal final convergence.
  - $\text{LR} = 10^{-4}$: Too slow to converge within reasonable compute budgets.
  - $\text{LR} = 10^{-3}$: Optimal convergence rate and superior validation PSNR, verifying the Stanford CS229 finding.

### Slide 7: Quantitative Benchmark Results
- **Summary Benchmark Table on Held-Out Test Set (20 Images):**

| Method / Model | Test MSE | Test PSNR (dB) | Test SSIM | Parameters |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Nearest Neighbor | 0.002628 | 26.67 dB | 0.8535 | Hand-crafted (0) |
| Bilinear Interpolation | 0.002283 | 27.46 dB | 0.8504 | Hand-crafted (0) |
| Bicubic Interpolation | 0.001790 | 28.63 dB | 0.8815 | Hand-crafted (0) |
| Standard SRCNN (20 ep) | 0.003654 | 24.90 dB | 0.7913 | 20,099 |
| **Residual SRCNN (Best)** | **0.001492** | **29.46 dB** | **0.9007** | **20,099** |

- **Key Takeaways for Review Committee:**
  - Residual SRCNN outperforms Bicubic interpolation by **+0.83 dB in PSNR** and **+0.0192 in SSIM**.
  - Bicubic interpolation achieves +1.96 dB gain over Nearest Neighbor.
  - $\text{LR} = 0.001$ yields optimal stability and convergence speed.
  - All metrics programmatically logged in `results/experiment_results.csv`.

### Slide 8: Qualitative Visual Comparisons
- **Visual Evidence across Test Images:**
  - Low-resolution inputs exhibit severe softness and blurry boundaries.
  - Bicubic baseline smooths artifacts but fails to recover high-contrast edges.
  - SRCNN sharply resolves object boundaries, edge transitions, and planar textures.
  - Zoom-in detail crops demonstrate that SRCNN removes false color halos and enhances fine structural lines.

---

### Slide 9: Limitations & Future Enhancements
- **Current Limitations of SRCNN:**
  - Pre-upsampling computation: Computing convolutions on $224 \times 224$ inputs is computationally heavier than low-resolution space processing.
  - Fixed receptive field: $13 \times 13$ receptive field cannot capture long-range non-local redundancies.
  - Pixel MSE loss tends to average high-frequency textures, producing smooth rather than ultra-textured photographic grain.
- **Future Directions:**
  - Sub-pixel convolution (ESPCN) / Deconvolution (FSRCNN) for faster real-time inference.
  - Deep Residual Networks (VDSR / EDSR) to overcome vanishing gradients in deeper models.
  - Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGAN / ESRGAN) with Perceptual VGG Loss to hallucinate photo-realistic details.
